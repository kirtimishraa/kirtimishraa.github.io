{"pages":[{"permalink":"https://minimal-black-demo.netlify.app/about/","section":"","summary":"\rWho We Are\rWe’re a specialist growth team that partners deeply with a small number of brands, operating as an extension of their growth function. We design strategy and run full-stack growth across performance marketing, organic distribution, web and landing experiences, creative, and technical foundations.\nHow We Work\rWe don’t run campaigns for the sake of spend. Before scaling, we run deep market and competitor research, along with 360° technical audits across tracking, website performance, SEO health, and product positioning. Paid media is deployed only once the foundations are solid. From there, we systematically test creatives, audiences, bids, and funnels to drive efficient, compounding growth - while building organic channels that perform beyond paid.\n","title":"About Us"}]}
